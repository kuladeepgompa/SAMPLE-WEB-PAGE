        <p>
          The ocean drives global systems that make the Earth habitable for
          humankind. Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate,
          coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we
          breathe are all ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. Despite
          this, oceans are under significant threat due to human activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          From pollution to overfishing and climate change, the challenges
          facing our oceans are immense, but so are the opportunities to protect
          and restore them. The Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) aims to
          "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources
          for sustainable development."

            <h3>Fact 1</h3>
            <p>
              Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth’s surface, and are
              critical to regulating the climate, absorbing CO2, and providing
              resources for life on Earth.
            </p>

          <div class="fact-card">
            <h3>Fact 2</h3>
            <p>
              Over 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity
              for their livelihoods, with the fishing industry alone employing
              millions globally.

          <div class="fact-card">
            <h3>Fact 3</h3>
            <p>
              Oceans absorb about 30% of the carbon dioxide produced by humans,
              buffering the impacts of global warming, but this also contributes
              to ocean acidification, threatening marine ecosystems.

            <h3>Fact 4</h3>
            <p>
              More than 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans every year,
              leading to severe consequences for marine life, including
              entanglement, ingestion, and toxic chemical pollution.

          <li>
            Pollution, particularly from plastics and chemicals, severely
            impacts marine life and ecosystems. Microplastics have been found in
            the deepest parts of the ocean, affecting even the smallest
            organisms at the base of the marine food chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overfishing leads to the depletion of fish stocks and disrupts
            marine biodiversity. About 33% of global fish stocks are
            overexploited, pushing some species to the brink of extinction.
          </li>
          <li>
            Climate change causes ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and
            rising sea levels. Coral reefs, which support about 25% of all
            marine species, are particularly vulnerable, with more than half
            already experiencing bleaching.
          </li>
          <li>
            Destructive fishing practices such as bottom trawling and the use of
            explosives not only deplete fish populations but also destroy
            essential marine habitats like coral reefs and seagrass beds.

          efforts to policy changes. Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Reducing plastic use by opting for reusable items and participating
            in local beach cleanup efforts to help prevent marine debris.
          </li>
          <li>
            Supporting sustainable seafood consumption by choosing certified
            products that follow eco-friendly fishing practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advocating for stronger ocean protection laws and international
            agreements, such as the banning of harmful fishing subsidies that
            contribute to overfishing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Backing research and innovation aimed at creating solutions for
            marine conservation, such as biodegradable materials and marine

              Global efforts to expand Marine Protected Areas have shown
              positive results. Chile, for example, created one of the largest
              MPAs in the world, preserving over 1 million square kilometers of
              ocean territory.
